  **Pastor’s May Newsletter**


  There’s an old saying regarding the relationship of weather and flora in the Spring: “April showers bring May flowers.” We had the April showers; now here come the May flowers! This is the month when God shows off some extraordinary gardening skills! Our senses of sight, sound, and smell are blessed by the beauty of flowers and greenery, the melodious sounds of birds singing, and the fragrant smell of blossoms filling the air with God’s natural perfume! What wonderful gifts of God for the people of God! It seems to me this is one of God’s ways of telling us we are loved.


  God has many other ways of showing us Divine and Unconditional love. Some are a bit more subtle than the sights, smells, and sounds of Spring. Some could be in the form of a simple note or card letting us know that someone is thinking of us and perhaps even praying for us. As we open the card or note, it seems we can almost feel the gentle breathe of the Holy Spirit escaping from the envelope! I received such a card a few days ago, and it warmed my heart and lifted my spirit. Someone felt a nudge from the Spirit and responded. It’s truly amazing how big a small thing can be!


  I firmly believe that God’s love is manifested through the response of God’s people to the “nudge” of the Spirit. And as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.” *(NIV 1 Cor. 1:4 – 8a).* 


  In a world where acts of hatred, tyranny, terrorism, and war seem to dominate the headlines, I propose we herald some Good News: **“Christ is Risen!**  **Alleluia!”** This is not just Easter News, it’s the Daily News!  Thanks be to God! Amen!


  In Christ,


  Pastor Dave

  We believe that humanity is saved by faith in what God has done for us in
  Jesus Christ. This is a gift of grace. Then our faith expresses itself in life
  of love and service toward God and His people.


  We place special emphasis on a Biblical and Christ-centered educational program for all ages.


  We believe that individuals experience joy and peace in hearing from Jesus through worship, word, and holy communion.


  We are concerned with the total well-being of individuals - spiritual, mental, physical, and social. 


  We reach out to all of the world and its people with a message of forgiveness, hope, and salvation. We are saved by God's grace.
