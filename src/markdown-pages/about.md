  We believe that humanity is saved by faith in what God has done for us in
  Jesus Christ. This is a gift of grace. Then our faith expresses itself in life
  of love and service toward God and His people.


  We place special emphasis on a Biblical and Christ-centered educational program for all ages.


  We believe that individuals experience joy and peace in hearing from Jesus through worship, word, and holy communion.


  We are concerned with the total well-being of individuals - spiritual, mental, physical, and social. 


  We reach out to all of the world and its people with a message of forgiveness, hope, and salvation. We are saved by God's grace.
